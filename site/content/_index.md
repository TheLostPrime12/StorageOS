    text: All software is made possible by many, many people who dedicate time to building tools, coding languages, and frameworks for the public domain.
    text: With software, possibilities are limitless. Scratch, what's commonly known as a simple game builing engine, has become home to fully-fleged multiplayer games, OBJ renderers, HTML editors, and, soon, a working operating system.
